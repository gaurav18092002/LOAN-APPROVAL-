# 🏦 Loan Approval Data Analysis

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a home loan dataset to identify key factors that influence loan approval decisions. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights in applicant data through **statistical exploration and visualizations**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The analysis focuses on:

* Understanding the dataset structure and cleaning missing values.
* Exploring applicant demographics, loan details, and approval status.
* Identifying correlations between income, loan amount, credit history, and approval outcomes.
* Communicating findings using intuitive visualizations.

---

## 🔎 Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

   * Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
   * Converted categorical variables into the right formats.

2. **Univariate Analysis**

   * Histograms, bar charts, and pie charts for distributions of numerical and categorical features.

3. **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis**

   * Boxplots and scatter plots to study relationships between applicant details and loan approval status.
   * Correlation heatmap to highlight numeric relationships.
   * Stacked bar charts to show categorical comparisons.

4. **Insights & Findings**

   * Credit history and applicant income strongly impact loan approval.
   * Demographic attributes (like education and marital status) also show distinct approval trends.

## 📊 Tools & Libraries

* **Python**: Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Notebook**: Jupyter
